# Bayesian Spam/Ham Classifier

## Model Details

The Bayesian Spam/Ham Classifier uses the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model, a probabilistic algorithm that's effective for binary classification tasks. It's trained on a labeled dataset of spam and ham messages, learning to distinguish between the two based on the presence or absence of certain features.

## Data

You can train and evaluate the classifier using your own dataset of labeled spam and ham messages. Make sure your dataset includes text messages or emails along with their corresponding labels (e.g., 1 for spam, 0 for ham).

## Evaluation

Evaluate the classifier's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can implement evaluation scripts and test the classifier on a validation or test dataset.
